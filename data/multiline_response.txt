Ah, the elegant simplicity of a "Hello World" application in Rust. Here is the code, accompanied by explanations:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Now, let me elucidate the lines of this succinct program:

1. `fn main() {` - This declares the main function, which is the entry point of the program. In Rust, every program must have a `main` function.

2. `println!("Hello, world!");` - This is a macro invocation that prints the string "Hello, world!" to the console. The `println!` macro is used for formatted output.

3. `}` - This closing brace signifies the end of the `main` function.

And there you have it, a concise yet eloquent introduction to the world of Rust programming.
