Yes, when using the ChatGPT API, you need to include the conversation history 
(prompt and responses) in the `messages` parameter of each request. You should 
prepend the new message to the list and for each message, you need to include a 
`role` (which can be "system", "user", or "assistant") and `content` (the text 
of the message).

There is no direct support for context identifiers or request reference IDs in 
the API. You can achieve this by including a system-level instruction in the 
conversation history. For example, you can include a system message that 
describes the context or provide a special instruction to refer to the previous 
message.

Here's an example API call with conversation history:

```
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant that speaks like 
Shakespeare."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "tell me a joke"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why did the chicken cross the road?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "I don't know, why did the chicken cross 
the road?"}
    ]
)
```

In the above example, the conversation history is included in the `messages` 
parameter, and each message includes a role (system, user, or assistant) and 
the content of the message. The previous messages are used to provide context 
for the model to generate responses.
